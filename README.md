# PC Random Number Generator

Program I made to test the randomness of `rand()` function.  
As more iterations are ran, the numbers are more equal. It simulates a dice.  

Usage: `pcrng [iterations]`  
Default number of iterations is 0x7fffffff (2147483647)  

Shows the percent of each number and the amount of matches they had.
